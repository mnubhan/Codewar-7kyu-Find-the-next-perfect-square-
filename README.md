Find the next perfect square!
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
<br>
Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
<br>
If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.
<br>
Examples:(Input --> Output)
<br>
121 --> 144
<br>
625 --> 676
<br>
114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square
